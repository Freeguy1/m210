===================
 M210 installation
===================

M210 consist of four modules: pylib, daemon, cli and qt. Each provide
their own setup.py script and needs to be installed
separately. Alternatively, you can just run::

  ./install.sh

which does exactly the same thing.

Simplified dependency chart
===========================

::

  PyQt4 m210.pylib dbus-python
     ^      ^        ^
     |      |        |
     +--m210.daemon--+
         ^       ^
         |       |
    m210.cli  m210.qt

The above chart shows, that the M210-daemon is the heart of the
M210. M210-cli and M210-qt are just user interfaces for the
daemon. You are not required to install them if you don't want to,
just provide your own interface (for example GTK+). The daemon itself
depends on M210-pylib, PyQt4 (mainloop) and Python bindings for DBus.
