To build this package you need to have:

- libudev0 ( shared libudev library, probably already provided by your system )
- libudev-dev ( development files, i.e. headers for libudev )

  In Debian and it's derivatives:

    apt-get install libudev-dev

Then, just:

  python setup.py build

There is also a predefined udev rules file in etc/udev/rules.d. You
can just copy that to /etc/udev/rules.d to allow udevd set a bit more
loose rw-rights for your m210 devices when they are plugged in.
