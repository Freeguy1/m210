Features
========

- Download notes in raw format (memory dump).
- Convert raw notes to SVG images.
- Erase notes from the device.
- Show device information.

How to install
==============

M210 uses libudev and therefore requires libudev development
files, more specifically libudev.h, to get compiled. On Debian and
its derivatives, the header file is packaged in libudev-dev.

After satisfying dependencies described above, the basic installation
is easy. Just run the following command:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install

It installs the library to /usr/local/lib and header files to
/usr/local/include. See INSTALL for details.

There is also a predefined udev rules file in etc/udev/rules.d. You
can just copy that to /etc/udev/rules.d to allow udevd to give group
ownership of plugged M210 devices to plugdev.

How to use
==========

Download notes to a file:

  m210 dump > notes

Convert downloaded notes to SVG files:

  m210 convert < notes

Erase notes from the device's memory:

  m210 delete

Display device information:

  m210 info
